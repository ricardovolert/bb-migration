Scripts and notes for migrating from BitBucket

The YTEP and its discussion can be found here: https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/ytep/pull-requests/68/adding-draft-github-migration-ytep/diff

Note the three stages; stage 1 will involve keeping a mirror in one-way sync, and stage 2 will be the time during which we migrate.  Stage 3 is "complete."

## TODO Items

TODO items will be noted in the issues page for this repository at https://github.com/yt-project/bb-migration/issues

## Mirror handler
